## Code example:

Solution for the [_'A.'_ task from YandexCup](https://yandex.ru/cup/frontend/analysis/), which works about 2x faster that solution from Yandex on HUGE arrays.  
Why is it faster? Because instead of overriding values with 0, we remove them from array, so with every loop there is less items to loop for.

```
const findLatestWeight = function (weights) {
  if (weights.length <= 1) {
    return weights[0];
  }

  do {
    let big = 0
    let beforeBig = 0
    let bigI = 0
    let beforeBigI = 0
    for (let i = 0; i < weights.length; i++) {
      const weight = weights[i];
      if (weight >= big) {
        beforeBig = big
        big = weight

        beforeBigI = bigI
        bigI = i
      } else if (weight > beforeBig) {
        beforeBig = weight
        beforeBigI = i

      }
    }
    if (beforeBig === 0) {
      return big
    }

    let annigilationResult = big - beforeBig


    if (annigilationResult) {
      weights[bigI] = annigilationResult
      if (weights.length !== beforeBigI + 1) {
        weights[beforeBigI] = weights.pop()
      } else {
        weights.pop()
      }
    } else {

      if (bigI < beforeBigI) {
        [bigI, beforeBigI] = [beforeBigI, bigI]
      }
      if (weights.length === bigI + 1) {
        weights.pop()
      } else {
        weights[bigI] = weights.pop()
      }

      if (weights.length === beforeBigI + 1) {
        weights.pop()
      } else {
        weights[beforeBigI] = weights.pop()
      }
    }
  } while (true);
}
```
